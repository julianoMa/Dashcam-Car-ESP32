# Dashcam Car ESP32
As my parents encounter many dangers on road, I decided to create a custom Dashcam for their car.
I'm going to write all my researchs here, and later put the code.

## Components
### Board
I'm picking the ESP32-Wrover from Freenove on [Aliexpress](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005004339923548.html), it has an CSI interface.

### Camera
I will not use the provided cam with the board, because it has not much video quality, the provided one is the [OV2640](https://www.uctronics.com/download/cam_module/OV2640DS.pdf).
