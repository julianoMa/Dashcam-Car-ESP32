# Dashcam Car ESP32
As my parents encounter many dangers on road, I decided to create a custom Dashcam for their car.
I'm going to write all my researchs here, and later put the code.

## Components
### Board
I'm picking the ESP32-Wrover-DEV from Freenove on [Aliexpress](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005004339923548.html), it has an CSI interface.

**Price :** 5.75€ (with Aliexpress welcome offer)

### Camera
I will not use the provided cam with the board, because it has not much video quality, the provided one is the [OV2640](https://www.uctronics.com/download/cam_module/OV2640DS.pdf) and it's even not the right interface !

I found this pretty [OV5647](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005006064966176.html) on Aliexpress, I will use it.

**Price :** 3.64€
### Storage
I'm using an [SanDisk 64Gb](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005006572226710) micro SD card.

**Price :** 4.11€

### Micro SD Card Reader
I will use this [micro SD card reader](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005006248599786.html).

**Price :** 0.78€

### Total Price
The total price come up to 14.28€
